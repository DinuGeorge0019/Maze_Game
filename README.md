# Maze_Game

This is a small game developed by me using the olcConsoleGameEngine.

The library can be found at : https://github.com/OneLoneCoder

# Game description : 
A simple maze that you have to escape. Along the catacombs of the labyrinth you will encounter enemies who will try to kill you. You can protect yourself using your sword, but be carefull, the enemies are not dumb, they are fast and dangerous. Of course you are not alone in this maze, there are friends with you who are willing to give you some help. The problem is that you have to find, and rescue them. And do not forget, your only mission is to escape the maze (don't be greedy for treasures or you might end up dying).
